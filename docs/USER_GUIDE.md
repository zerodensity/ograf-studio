## File types

| File                      | Purpose                             | How to open it                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.ogs`                    | Editable OGraf Studio source        | **Open Project**                                                                                |

| `.ograf.zip`              | Certified playout package           | **Import OGraf** for best-effort editable conversion, or extract it for an OGraf player/devtool |
| Loose OGraf package files | Manifest, `main.js`, and resources  | Select them together with **Import OGraf**                                                      |
| SVG and raster images     | Reusable image assets               | **Add Image** above the canvas, or drop files onto the canvas                                   |
| Lottie `.json`            | Looping vector animation layer      | **+ Lottie JSON** above the canvas                                                              |

An `.ogs` file is not an OGraf manifest and should not be opened directly in an OGraf playout
tool. A `.ograf.zip` is the deployable output, but arbitrary third-party JavaScript cannot always be
reconstructed as editable layers. The import report lists everything recovered, defaulted, or lost.

Opening remains backward-compatible with legacy `.ogeproj` and `.ogeproj.json` source files. New
browser downloads, picker saves, reference templates, and MCP saves use `.ogs` exclusively.

### Remote project URLs

Use **Open URL** to download editable `.ogs` source from an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL. OGraf
Studio sends no credentials, follows only HTTP(S) redirects, limits the response to 32 MiB, parses
and validates the source before loading, and asks before replacing the current project. The remote
server must allow browser CORS access.

A public GitHub repository is suitable storage. Use the raw-file URL, not the normal `/blob/` page:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/main/path/project.ogs
```

Use a commit SHA instead of `main` when the URL must identify an immutable project revision. Public
repositories expose the complete `.ogs`, including embedded image/font data and field defaults;
do not store private content or credentials in them. Private GitHub raw URLs are not supported by
the credential-free browser loader, although a CORS-enabled time-limited signed URL can work.

### Adding and replacing images

Click **Add Image** above the canvas to choose files or pick a thumbnail from the template's
existing images. You can also drop image files directly onto the canvas. Each image becomes a
named layer at its original proportions; large images fit within 80% of the canvas and smaller
images retain their native size. Multiple files are added together with a slight offset.

Select an image layer to see its preview and **Replace image** near the top of Properties.
Replacement preserves the layer's size, position, animation, effects and bindings. Bound data can
still override the source during playback. **Source URL** remains available for linked images.
Resources → Images also offers **Add to canvas** on each expanded image.

Cancelling or failing an import leaves no empty layer. Undo restores the image and its resource
together. PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, AVIF and standalone SVG files are supported when the browser can
decode them; GIF timing retains the existing runtime behavior. SVGs with companion files use the
bundle workflow below.

### SVG and Photoshop exports

Use **Resources → Import Image/SVG Bundle** and select one SVG together with its companion CSS,
linked images, and local font files. OGraf Studio injects the CSS into the SVG, replaces selected
relative image/font URLs with data URIs, removes the external XML stylesheet reference, and
registers selected fonts as project font assets. Any unresolved relative URL is reported in the
Resources panel. The result remains one portable image asset; Photoshop's rasterized content and
arbitrary SVG structure are not decomposed into independently editable studio layers.

MCP clients can perform the same portable import through `ograf_import_svg_bundle`, or ingest one
workspace-confined file through `ograf_import_asset`. Both tools enforce file and aggregate payload
limits before committing one revision-checked asset transaction.

### Lottie animations

Use **+ Lottie JSON** above the canvas, or replace the JSON from a selected Lottie layer's
Properties. The first supported profile is intentionally deterministic and portable:

- the Bodymovin/Lottie JSON is embedded in the editable project and exported OGraf module;
- playback loops continuously, with an editable non-negative speed multiplier;
- editor scrubbing and non-realtime `goToTime()` derive the exact Lottie frame from composition
  time; realtime playback uses the same absolute-time frame calculation;
- `load()` predecodes embedded images and waits for fonts and the initial Canvas frame; failures
  return an error instead of allowing a blank graphic to pass as ready;
- a positive adapter-owned backing Canvas avoids zero-sized matte buffers and unsafe player resize
  calls. CSS reframes that backing when the layer box changes;
- nonzero source in-points are mapped to the player's relative frame API, and changed non-realtime
  seeks rebuild the player for byte-repeatable output;
- the self-hosted light canvas player is bundled into `main.js`, with no CDN dependency;
- expressions are disabled; external image/font paths, segmented documents, undecodable image
  payloads, and luma mattes are rejected. Export images inside the JSON as data URIs, use alpha
  mattes, or convert artwork to shapes/glyphs.

A small compatible animation is included at `examples/lottie/pulse.json`. The pinned
[Lottie reliability benchmark](benchmarks/2026-09-04-lottie-reliability.md) separates light/full
Canvas fidelity, repeatability, and exported-runtime evidence. Marker control, one-shot playback,
dynamic Lottie text/data binding, separate image folders, renderer selection, and target-device
certification remain deferred.
